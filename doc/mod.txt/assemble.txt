SYNOPSIS                           *assemble*

Assembles a configuration file from fragments. Often a particular program will take a single configuration file and does not support a conf.d style structure where it is easy to build up the
configuration from multiple sources. assemble will take a directory of files that can be local or have already been transferred to the system, and concatenate them together to produce a
destination file. Files are assembled in string sorting order. Puppet calls this idea fragments.

EXAMPLES                           *assemble-examples*

    # Example from Ansible Playbooks
    - assemble: src=/etc/someapp/fragments dest=/etc/someapp/someapp.conf
   
    # When a delimiter is specified, it will be inserted in between each fragment
    - assemble: src=/etc/someapp/fragments dest=/etc/someapp/someapp.conf delimiter='### START FRAGMENT ###'
