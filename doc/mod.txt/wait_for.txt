SYNOPSIS                           *wait_for*

Waiting for a port to become available is useful for when services are not immediately available after their init scripts return - which is true of certain Java application servers. It is also
useful when starting guests with the virt module and needing to pause until they are ready. This module can also be used to wait for a regex match a string to be present in a file. In 1.6 and
later, this module can also be used to wait for a file to be available or absent on the filesystem. In 1.8 and later, this module can also be used to wait for active connections to be closed
before continuing, useful if a node is being rotated out of a load balancer pool.

EXAMPLES                           *wait_for-examples*
>
    # wait 300 seconds for port 8000 to become open on the host, don't start checking for 10 seconds
    - wait_for: port=8000 delay=10
   
    # wait 300 seconds for port 8000 of any IP to close active connections, don't start checking for 10 seconds
    - wait_for: host=0.0.0.0 port=8000 delay=10 state=drained
   
    # wait 300 seconds for port 8000 of any IP to close active connections, ignoring connections for specified hosts
    - wait_for: host=0.0.0.0 port=8000 state=drained exclude_hosts=10.2.1.2,10.2.1.3
   
    # wait until the file /tmp/foo is present before continuing
    - wait_for: path=/tmp/foo
   
    # wait until the string "completed" is in the file /tmp/foo before continuing
    - wait_for: path=/tmp/foo search_regex=completed
   
    # wait until the lock file is removed
    - wait_for: path=/var/lock/file.lock state=absent
   
    # wait until the process is finished and pid was destroyed
    - wait_for: path=/proc/3466/status state=absent
   
    # Wait 300 seconds for port 22 to become open and contain "OpenSSH", don't start checking for 10 seconds
    - local_action: wait_for port=22 host="{{ inventory_hostname }}" search_regex=OpenSSH delay=10
   
      Note
   
      The ability to use search_regex with a port connection was added in 1.7.
