EXAMPLES                           *stat-examples*
>
    # Obtain the stats of /etc/foo.conf, and check that the file still belongs
    # to 'root'. Fail otherwise.
    - stat: path=/etc/foo.conf
      register: st
    - fail: msg="Whoops! file ownership has changed"
      when: st.stat.pw_name != 'root'
   
    # Determine if a path exists and is a directory.  Note that we need to test
    # both that p.stat.isdir actually exists, and also that it's set to true.
    - stat: path=/path/to/something
      register: p
    - debug: msg="Path exists and is a directory"
      when: p.stat.isdir is defined and p.stat.isdir
   
    # Don't do md5 checksum
    - stat: path=/path/to/myhugefile get_md5=no
