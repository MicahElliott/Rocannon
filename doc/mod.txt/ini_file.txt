SYNOPSIS                           *ini_file*

Manage (add, remove, change) individual settings in an INI-style file without having to manage the file as a whole with, say, template or assemble. Adds missing sections if they don’t exist.
Comments are discarded when the source file is read, and therefore will not show up in the destination file.

EXAMPLES                           *ini_file-examples*
>
    # Ensure "fav=lemonade is in section "[drinks]" in specified file
    - ini_file: dest=/etc/conf section=drinks option=fav value=lemonade mode=0600 backup=yes
   
    - ini_file: dest=/etc/anotherconf
                section=drinks
                option=temperature
                value=cold
                backup=yes
   
      Note
   
      While it is possible to add an option without specifying a value, this makes no sense.
   
      Note
   
      A section named default cannot be added by the module, but if it exists, individual options within the section can be updated. (This is a limitation of Python’s ConfigParser.) Either use
      template to create a base INI file with a [default] section, or use lineinfile to add the missing line.
