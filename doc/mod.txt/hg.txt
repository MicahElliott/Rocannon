SYNOPSIS                           *hg*

New in version 1.0.

Manages Mercurial (hg) repositories. Supports SSH, HTTP/S and local address.

EXAMPLES                           *hg-examples*
>
    # Ensure the current working copy is inside the stable branch and deletes untracked files if any.
    - hg: repo=https://bitbucket.org/user/repo1 dest=/home/user/repo1 revision=stable purge=yes
   
      Note
   
      If the task seems to be hanging, first verify remote host is in known_hosts. SSH will prompt user to authorize the first contact with a remote host. To avoid this prompt, one solution is to add
      the remote host public key in /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts before calling the hg module, with the following command: ssh-keyscan remote_host.com >> /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts.
