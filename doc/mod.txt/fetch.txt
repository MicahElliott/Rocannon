SYNOPSIS                           *fetch*

This module works like copy, but in reverse. It is used for fetching files from remote machines and storing them locally in a file tree, organized by hostname. Note that this module is written
to transfer log files that might not be present, so a missing remote file won’t be an error unless fail_on_missing is set to ‘yes’.

EXAMPLES                           *fetch-examples*
>
    # Store file into /tmp/fetched/host.example.com/tmp/somefile
    - fetch: src=/tmp/somefile dest=/tmp/fetched
   
    # Specifying a path directly
    - fetch: src=/tmp/somefile dest=/tmp/prefix-{{ ansible_hostname }} flat=yes
   
    # Specifying a destination path
    - fetch: src=/tmp/uniquefile dest=/tmp/special/ flat=yes
   
    # Storing in a path relative to the playbook
    - fetch: src=/tmp/uniquefile dest=special/prefix-{{ ansible_hostname }} flat=yes
