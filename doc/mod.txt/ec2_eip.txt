EXAMPLES                           *ec2_eip-examples*
>
    - name: associate an elastic IP with an instance
      ec2_eip: instance_id=i-1212f003 ip=93.184.216.119
   
    - name: disassociate an elastic IP from an instance
      ec2_eip: instance_id=i-1212f003 ip=93.184.216.119 state=absent
   
    - name: allocate a new elastic IP and associate it with an instance
      ec2_eip: instance_id=i-1212f003
   
    - name: allocate a new elastic IP without associating it to anything
      action: ec2_eip
      register: eip
    - name: output the IP
      debug: msg="Allocated IP is {{ eip.public_ip }}"
   
    - name: provision new instances with ec2
      ec2: keypair=mykey instance_type=c1.medium image=ami-40603AD1 wait=yes group=webserver count=3
      register: ec2
    - name: associate new elastic IPs with each of the instances
      ec2_eip: "instance_id={{ item }}"
      with_items: ec2.instance_ids
   
    - name: allocate a new elastic IP inside a VPC in us-west-2
      ec2_eip: region=us-west-2 in_vpc=yes
      register: eip
    - name: output the IP
      debug: msg="Allocated IP inside a VPC is {{ eip.public_ip }}"
   
      Note
   
      This module will return public_ip on success, which will contain the public IP address associated with the instance.
   
      Note
   
      There may be a delay between the time the Elastic IP is assigned and when the cloud instance is reachable via the new address. Use wait_for and pause to delay further playbook execution until
      the instance is reachable, if necessary.
   
      Note
   
      The following environment variables can be used AWS_ACCESS_KEY or EC2_ACCESS_KEY or AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_KEY or EC2_SECRET_KEY or AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION,
      AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN
   
      Note
   
      Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no credentials are provided. See http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html
   
      Note
   
      AWS_REGION or EC2_REGION can be typically be used to specify the AWS region, when required, but this can also be configured in the boto config file
