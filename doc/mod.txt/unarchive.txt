SYNOPSIS                           *unarchive*

New in version 1.4.

The unarchive module copies an archive file from the local machine to a remote and unpacks it.

EXAMPLES                           *unarchive-examples*
>
    # Example from Ansible Playbooks
    - unarchive: src=foo.tgz dest=/var/lib/foo
   
    # Unarchive a file that is already on the remote machine
    - unarchive: src=/tmp/foo.zip dest=/usr/local/bin copy=no
   
      Note
   
      requires tar/unzip command on target host
   
      Note
   
      can handle gzip, bzip2 and xz compressed as well as uncompressed tar files
   
      Note
   
      detects type of archive automatically
   
      Note
   
      uses tarâ€™s --diff arg to calculate if changed or not. If this arg is not supported, it will always unpack the archive
   
      Note
   
      does not detect if a .zip file is different from destination - always unzips
   
      Note
   
      existing files/directories in the destination which are not in the archive are not touched. This is the same behavior as a normal archive extraction
   
      Note
   
      existing files/directories in the destination which are not in the archive are ignored for purposes of deciding if the archive should be unpacked or not
