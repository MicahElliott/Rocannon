SYNOPSIS                           *debconf*

New in version 1.6.

Configure a .deb package using debconf-set-selections. Or just query existing selections.

EXAMPLES                           *debconf-examples*
>
    # Set default locale to fr_FR.UTF-8
    debconf: name=locales question='locales/default_environment_locale' value=fr_FR.UTF-8 vtype='select'
   
    # set to generate locales:
    debconf: name=locales question='locales/locales_to_be_generated'  value='en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8, fr_FR.UTF-8 UTF-8' vtype='multiselect'
   
    # Accept oracle license
    debconf: name='oracle-java7-installer' question='shared/accepted-oracle-license-v1-1' value='true' vtype='select'
   
    # Specifying package you can register/return the list of questions and current values
    debconf: name='tzdata'
   
      Note
   
      This module requires the command line debconf tools.
   
      Note
   
      A number of questions have to be answered (depending on the package). Use ‘debconf-show <package>’ on any Debian or derivative with the package installed to see questions/settings available.
   
      Note
   
      Some distros will always record tasks involving the setting of passwords as changed. This is due to debconf-get-selections masking passwords.
