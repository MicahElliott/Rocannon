>
    # Example creating a new service hook. It ignores duplicates.
    - github_hooks: action=create hookurl=http://11.111.111.111:2222 user={{ gituser }} oauthkey={{ oauthkey }} repo=https://api.github.com/repos/pcgentry/Github-Auto-Deploy
   
    # Cleaning all hooks for this repo that had an error on the last update. Since this works for all hooks in a repo it is probably best that this would be called from a handler.
