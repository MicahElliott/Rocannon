SYNOPSIS                           *assert*

New in version 1.5.

This module asserts that a given expression is true and can be a simpler alternative to the ‘fail’ module in some cases.

EXAMPLES                           *assert-examples*

    - assert: { that: "ansible_os_family != 'RedHat'" }
   
    - assert:
        that:
          - "'foo' in some_command_result.stdout"
          - "number_of_the_counting == 3"
