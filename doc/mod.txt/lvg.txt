SYNOPSIS                           *lvg*

New in version 1.1.

This module creates, removes or resizes volume groups.

EXAMPLES                           *lvg-examples*
>
    # Create a volume group on top of /dev/sda1 with physical extent size = 32MB.
    - lvg:  vg=vg.services pvs=/dev/sda1 pesize=32
   
    # Create or resize a volume group on top of /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdc5.
    # If, for example, we already have VG vg.services on top of /dev/sdb1,
    # this VG will be extended by /dev/sdc5.  Or if vg.services was created on
    # top of /dev/sda5, we first extend it with /dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdc5,
    # and then reduce by /dev/sda5.
    - lvg: vg=vg.services pvs=/dev/sdb1,/dev/sdc5
   
    # Remove a volume group with name vg.services.
    - lvg: vg=vg.services state=absent
   
      Note
   
      module does not modify PE size for already present volume group
