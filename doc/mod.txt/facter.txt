github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras to see if a bug has already been filed. If not, we would be grateful if you would file one.

Note that this module is designated a “extras” module. Non-core modules are still fully usable, but may receive slightly lower response rates for issues and pull requests. Popular “extras”
modules may be promoted to core modules over time.
