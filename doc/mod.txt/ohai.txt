SYNOPSIS                           *ohai*

Similar to the facter module, this runs the Ohai discovery program (http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Ohai) on the remote host and returns JSON inventory data. Ohai data is a bit more verbose
and nested than facter.

Note

Requires ohai

Examples¶

# Retrieve (ohai) data from all Web servers and store in one-file per host
ansible webservers -m ohai --tree=/tmp/ohaidata

This is an Extras Module¶

This source of this module is hosted on GitHub in the ansible-modules-extras repo.

If you believe you have found a bug in this module, and are already running the latest stable or development version of Ansible, first look in the issue tracker at
github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras to see if a bug has already been filed. If not, we would be grateful if you would file one.

Should you have a question rather than a bug report, inquries are welcome on the ansible-project google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project> or on Ansible’s “#ansible”
channel, located on irc.freenode.net. Development oriented topics should instead use the similar ansible-devel google group.

Documentation updates for this module can also be edited directly by submitting a pull request to the module source code, just look for the “DOCUMENTATION” block in the source tree.

Note that this module is designated a “extras” module. Non-core modules are still fully usable, but may receive slightly lower response rates for issues and pull requests. Popular “extras”
modules may be promoted to core modules over time.
