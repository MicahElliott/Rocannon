SYNOPSIS                           *include_vars*

New in version 1.4.

Loads variables from a YAML file dynamically during task runtime. It can work with conditionals, or use host specific variables to determine the path name to load from.

EXAMPLES                           *include_vars-examples*
>
    # Conditionally decide to load in variables when x is 0, otherwise do not.
    - include_vars: contingency_plan.yml
      when: x == 0
   
    # Load a variable file based on the OS type, or a default if not found.
    - include_vars: "{{ item }}"
      with_first_found:
       - "{{ ansible_distribution }}.yml"
       - "{{ ansible_os_family }}.yml"
       - "default.yml"
