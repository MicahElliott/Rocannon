SYNOPSIS                           *accelerate*

New in version 1.3.

This modules launches an ephemeral accelerate daemon on the remote node which Ansible can use to communicate with nodes at high speed. The daemon listens on a configurable port for a
configurable amount of time. Fireball mode is AES encrypted

EXAMPLES                           *accelerate-examples*
>
    # To use accelerate mode, simply add "accelerate: true" to your play. The initial
    # key exchange and starting up of the daemon will occur over SSH, but all commands and
    # subsequent actions will be conducted over the raw socket connection using AES encryption
   
    - hosts: devservers
      accelerate: true
      tasks:
          - command: /usr/bin/anything
   
      Note
   
      See the advanced playbooks chapter for more about using accelerated mode.
