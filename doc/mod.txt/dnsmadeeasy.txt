SYNOPSIS                           *dnsmadeeasy*

New in version 1.3.

Manages DNS records via the v2 REST API of the DNS Made Easy service. It handles records only; there is no manipulation of domains or monitor/account support yet. See:
http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/services/rest-api/

EXAMPLES                           *dnsmadeeasy-examples*
>
    # fetch my.com domain records
    - dnsmadeeasy: account_key=key account_secret=secret domain=my.com state=present
      register: response
   
    # create / ensure the presence of a record
    - dnsmadeeasy: account_key=key account_secret=secret domain=my.com state=present record_name="test" record_type="A" record_value="127.0.0.1"
   
    # update the previously created record
    - dnsmadeeasy: account_key=key account_secret=secret domain=my.com state=present record_name="test" record_value="192.168.0.1"
   
    # fetch a specific record
    - dnsmadeeasy: account_key=key account_secret=secret domain=my.com state=present record_name="test"
      register: response
   
    # delete a record / ensure it is absent
    - dnsmadeeasy: account_key=key account_secret=secret domain=my.com state=absent record_name="test"
   
      Note
   
      The DNS Made Easy service requires that machines interacting with the API have the proper time and timezone set. Be sure you are within a few seconds of actual time by using NTP.
   
      Note
   
      This module returns record(s) in the “result” element when ‘state’ is set to ‘present’. This value can be be registered and used in your playbooks.
