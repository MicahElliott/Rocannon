SYNOPSIS                           *fireball*

This modules launches an ephemeral fireball ZeroMQ message bus daemon on the remote node which Ansible can use to communicate with nodes at high speed. The daemon listens on a configurable port
for a configurable amount of time. Starting a new fireball as a given user terminates any existing user fireballs. Fireball mode is AES encrypted

EXAMPLES                           *fireball-examples*
>
    # This example playbook has two plays: the first launches 'fireball' mode on all hosts via SSH, and
    # the second actually starts using it for subsequent management over the fireball connection

      gather_facts: false
