SYNOPSIS                           *raw*

Executes a low-down and dirty SSH command, not going through the module subsystem. This is useful and should only be done in two cases. The first case is installing python-simplejson on older
(Python 2.4 and before) hosts that need it as a dependency to run modules, since nearly all core modules require it. Another is speaking to any devices such as routers that do not have any
Python installed. In any other case, using the shell or command module is much more appropriate. Arguments given to raw are run directly through the configured remote shell. Standard output,
error output and return code are returned when available. There is no change handler support for this module. This module does not require python on the remote system, much like the script
module.

EXAMPLES                           *raw-examples*
>
    # Bootstrap a legacy python 2.4 host
    - raw: yum -y install python-simplejson
   
      Note
   
      If you want to execute a command securely and predictably, it may be better to use the command module instead. Best practices when writing playbooks will follow the trend of using command unless
      shell is explicitly required. When running ad-hoc commands, use your best judgement.
