SYNOPSIS                           *gc_storage*

New in version 1.4.

This module allows users to manage their objects/buckets in Google Cloud Storage. It allows upload and download operations and can set some canned permissions. It also allows retrieval of URLs
for objects for use in playbooks, and retrieval of string contents of objects. This module requires setting the default project in GCS prior to playbook usage. See
https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/reference/v1/apiversion1 for information about setting the default project.
