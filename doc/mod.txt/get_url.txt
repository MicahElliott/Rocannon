SYNOPSIS                           *get_url*

Downloads files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP to the remote server. The remote server must have direct access to the remote resource. By default, if an environment variable <protocol>_proxy is set on
the target host, requests will be sent through that proxy. This behaviour can be overridden by setting a variable for this task (see setting the environment), or by using the use_proxy option.
