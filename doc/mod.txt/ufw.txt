EXAMPLES                           *ufw-examples*
>
    # Allow everything and enable UFW
    ufw: state=enabled policy=allow
   
    # Set logging
    ufw: logging=on
   
    # Sometimes it is desirable to let the sender know when traffic is
    # being denied, rather than simply ignoring it. In these cases, use
    # reject instead of deny. In addition, log rejected connections:
    ufw: rule=reject port=auth log=yes
   
    # ufw supports connection rate limiting, which is useful for protecting
    # against brute-force login attacks. ufw will deny connections if an IP
    # address has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last
    # 30 seconds. See  http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/187
    # for details. Typical usage is:
    ufw: rule=limit port=ssh proto=tcp
   
    # Allow OpenSSH
    ufw: rule=allow name=OpenSSH
   
    # Delete OpenSSH rule
    ufw: rule=allow name=OpenSSH delete=yes
   
    # Deny all access to port 53:
    ufw: rule=deny port=53
   
    # Allow all access to tcp port 80:
    ufw: rule=allow port=80 proto=tcp
   
    # Allow all access from RFC1918 networks to this host:
    ufw: rule=allow src={{ item }}
    with_items:
    - 10.0.0.0/8
    - 172.16.0.0/12
    - 192.168.0.0/16
   
    # Deny access to udp port 514 from host 1.2.3.4:
    ufw: rule=deny proto=udp src=1.2.3.4 port=514
   
    # Allow incoming access to eth0 from 1.2.3.5 port 5469 to 1.2.3.4 port 5469
    ufw: rule=allow interface=eth0 direction=in proto=udp src=1.2.3.5 from_port=5469 dest=1.2.3.4 to_port=5469
   
    # Deny all traffic from the IPv6 2001:db8::/32 to tcp port 25 on this host.
    # Note that IPv6 must be enabled in /etc/default/ufw for IPv6 firewalling to work.
    ufw: rule=deny proto=tcp src=2001:db8::/32 port=25
   
      Note
   
      See man ufw for more examples.
