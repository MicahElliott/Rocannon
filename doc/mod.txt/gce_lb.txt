SYNOPSIS                           *gce_lb*

New in version 1.5.

This module can create and destroy Google Compute Engine loadbalancer and httphealthcheck resources. The primary LB resource is the load_balancer resource and the health check parameters are all
prefixed with httphealthcheck. The full documentation for Google Compute Engine load balancing is at https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/. However, the ansible module
simplifies the configuration by following the libcloud model. Full install/configuration instructions for the gce* modules can be found in the comments of ansible/test/gce_tests.py.
