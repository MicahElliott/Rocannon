SYNOPSIS                           *pause*

Pauses playbook execution for a set amount of time, or until a prompt is acknowledged. All parameters are optional. The default behavior is to pause with a prompt. You can use ctrl+c if you wish
to advance a pause earlier than it is set to expire or if you need to abort a playbook run entirely. To continue early: press ctrl+c and then c. To abort a playbook: press ctrl+c and then a. The
pause module integrates into async/parallelized playbooks without any special considerations (see also: Rolling Updates). When using pauses with the serial playbook parameter (as in rolling
updates) you are only prompted once for the current group of hosts.
