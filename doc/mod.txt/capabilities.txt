SYNOPSIS                           *capabilities*

New in version 1.6.

This module manipulates files privileges using the Linux capabilities(7) system.

EXAMPLES                           *capabilities-examples*
>
    # Set cap_sys_chroot+ep on /foo
    - capabilities: path=/foo capability=cap_sys_chroot+ep state=present
   
    # Remove cap_net_bind_service from /bar
    - capabilities: path=/bar capability=cap_net_bind_service state=absent
   
      Note
   
      The capabilities system will automatically transform operators and flags into the effective set, so (for example, cap_foo=ep will probably become cap_foo+ep). This module does not attempt to
      determine the final operator and flags to compare, so you will want to ensure that your capabilities argument matches the final capabilities.
